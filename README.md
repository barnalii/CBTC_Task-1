PORTFOLIO

I create a personal portfolio with the basic skills in CSS and HTML. This is yet again, one of the most common projects on web development for beginners. In a personal portfolio,  get to show a wide range of samples and skills and add my resume. I add an image at the top where i introduce myself, below that,  add contact information.
