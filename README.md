PORTFOLIO

I created a personal portfolio with basic skills in CSS and HTML. This is yet again, one of the most common projects on web development for beginners. In a personal portfolio,  get to show a wide range of samples and skills and add my resume. I added an image at the top where I introduce myself, below that,  add contact information.<br>
